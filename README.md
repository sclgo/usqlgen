# usqlgen

`usqlgen` creates custom distributions of [github.com/xo/usql](https://github.com/xo/usql) â€”
a universal single-binary SQL CLI, built by the [github.com/xo](https://github.com/xo) team, and 
inspired by [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html).

`usql` is great because it is a multi-platform, multi-database SQL client in a single binary. 
Learn more about it from its [README](https://github.com/xo/usql#readme).

`usqlgen` builds on usql's extensibility to allow including arbitrary drivers and other customizations,
without needing to fork.

## When to use

In most cases, using `usql` directly is best. `usqlgen` helps when you want to avoid editing `usql` code and:

- you want to use a database driver which is not publicly available or is under active development
- you want to use alternative driver for a database supported by `usql`. 
- you want to use a different version or a fork of a bundled driver
- you are working with a niche database which is not supported by `usql` yet
  - consider contributing the support to `usql` at some point
 
The Examples section details those usecases.

`usqlgen` is itself inspired by the 
[OpenTelemetry Collector builder](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/custom-collector/).

`usqlgen` needs Go to be installed but using it requires only minimal Go knowledge and doesn't
require editing any code.

## Installing

Install `usqlgen` with Go 1.21+:

```shell
go install github.com/sclgo/usqlgen@latest
```

You can also run usqlgen without installing:

```shell
go run github.com/sclgo/usqlgen@latest
```

If you don't have Go 1.21+, you can run `usqlgen` with Docker:

```shell
docker run --rm golang \
  go run github.com/sclgo/usqlgen@latest build --static ...add parameters here... -o - > ./usql

chmod +x ./usql
```

`usqlgen` isn't distributed as prebuilt binaries because running it requires Go installation anyway
(locally or within a container).

## Quickstart

To install `usql` with support for an additional driver, first review your driver documentation
to find the Go driver name, DSN ([Data Source Name](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql#Open)) format,
and package that needs to be imported.
Let's take for example, [MonetDB](https://github.com/MonetDB/MonetDB-Go#readme), which is not in `usql` yet. The docs
state that the package
that needs to be imported is `github.com/MonetDB/MonetDB-Go/v2`. We use this command to build `usql`:

```shell
usqlgen build --import "github.com/MonetDB/MonetDB-Go/v2"
```

This creates `usql` executable in the current directory with its default built-in drivers 
together with the driver for MonetDB.
The additional driver is registered using a side effect import (aka [blank import](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go#blank_import))
of the package in the `--import` parameter. The respective module is automatically
determined but can also be specified explicitly with `--get`.

Unlike built-in databases, the `usql` DB URL (connection string) for the new database 
is in the form `driverName:DSN`. For example, [MonetDB docs](https://github.com/MonetDB/MonetDB-Go#readme)
state that the driver name is `monetdb` and the DSN format is `username:password@hostname:50000/database`.
So to connect to MonetDB with the binary we just built, run:

```shell

# The command below is configured to connect to a local MonetDB started like this:
# docker run -p 50000:50000 -e MDB_DB_ADMIN_PASS=password monetdb/monetdb:latest

./usql monetdb:monetdb:password@localhost:50000/monetdb -c "select 'Hello World'"
```

Above `monetdb` is repeated in the beginning of the DB URL because it is both the Go driver name,
and the admin username in the beginning of the DSN.

You can try the same with databases or data engines like
[rqlite](https://github.com/rqlite/gorqlite?tab=readme-ov-file#driver-for-databasesql),
[Dremio or Apache Drill](https://github.com/factset/go-drill), etc.

`usqlgen` also allows you to import alternative drivers of supported databases. Examples include:

- [github.com/microsoft/gocosmos](https://github.com/microsoft/gocosmos) - an official(-ish) mirror of the unofficial
  driver included in `usql`
- [github.com/yugabyte/pgx/stdlib](https://github.com/yugabyte/pgx) - Standalone fork of the Postgres pgx driver with
  cluster-aware load balancing by [Yugabyte](https://www.yugabyte.com/)
- [github.com/mailru/go-clickhouse/v2](https://github.com/mailru/go-clickhouse) - HTTP-only alternative of the built-in Clickhouse driver
- [github.com/sclgo/adbcduck-go](https://github.com/sclgo/adbcduck-go) - alternative driver for DuckDB on top of
  [its ADBC API](https://duckdb.org/docs/clients/adbc)

For more options, see `usqlgen --help` or review the examples below.

## Limitations

Most `usql` [backslash (meta) commands](https://github.com/xo/usql?tab=readme-ov-file#backslash-commands) work 
with new drivers added with `--import`, including 
[cross-database `\copy`](https://github.com/xo/usql?tab=readme-ov-file#copying-between-databases).
Informational commands and autocomplete won't work though - [for now](https://github.com/sclgo/usqlgen/issues/50).

`usql` requires that connection strings are valid URIs or URLs, at least according to the Go `net/url` parsing algorithm.
If you get an error that parameter in the form `driverName:DSN` can't be parsed as a URL,
start `usql` without a connection string - in interactive mode or with the `-f` parameter. `usql` will start not connected to a DB.
Then use the `\connect` command with two arguments driverName and DSN. In the `monetdb` example above, that would be:
`\connect monetdb monetdb:password@localhost:50000/monetdb`.

## CGO usage

With `usqlgen`, [CGO support](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo) on the system is not needed in most cases.
In contrast, compiling `usql` the regular way does require CGO. With `usqlgen`, you only need CGO if you:

- import drivers that use CGO e.g. `--import github.com/sclgo/adbcduck-go`. The driver documentation should mention such
  usage.
- add drivers that use CGO with tags e.g. `-- -tags duckdb` .

When CGO is not available, `usqlgen build/install` commands modify the default "base" driver set,
replacing `sqlite3` (that requires CGO) with `moderncsqlite` (that doesn't).
In that case, using the `sqlite3` scheme will run `moderncsqlite` underneath.
`usqlgen` implements these replacements by adding build tags to the `go build` and 
`go install` commands, which may clash with tags you provided explicitly.
If you suspect that's the case, you can opt out of the above automation either:

- by adding `--dboptions keepcgo`
- by forcing Go to enable CGO with environment variable `CGO_ENABLED=1`.
- by adding tags to explicitly include or exclude relevant drivers e.g. `-- -tags no_sqlite3`

CGO is also affected by the `--static` flag for `usqlgen build`
or `usqlgen install` which disables `CGO` and enables static linking.

All in all, `usqlgen` and the `usql` binaries it produces are very portable, even more portable than regular `xo/usql`,
especially with `--static` flag.

## Examples

### Installing the customized `usql`

Use `usqlgen install ...` to install the customized `usql` to `GOPATH/bin` which is
typically on the search path. This runs `go install` internally.

```shell
usqlgen install --import "github.com/MonetDB/MonetDB-Go/v2"
usql -c '\drivers' | grep monetdb
# prints
#   monetdb [mo]
```

### Adding compilation options

`usqlgen build` and `usqlgen install` call `go build` and `go install` respectively.
You can pass options directly to the `go` commands after the `--` parameter.
For example, the following command supplies go build tag no_base which removes
all built-in `usql` drivers so only the custom one we add remains:

```shell
usqlgen build --import "github.com/MonetDB/MonetDB-Go/v2" -- -tags no_base
./usql -c '\drivers'
# prints only a single driver
```

In this case, the binary will be smaller and faster to build.

Review <https://github.com/xo/usql?tab=readme-ov-file#building> for build tags, supported
by `usql` and the documentation of `go build` and `go install` for other options.

Go environment variables like `GOPRIVATE` or `CGO_ENABLED` affect the compilation
as usual. For example, `GOPRIVATE` allows you to compile `usql` with drivers which
are not publicly available; `GOOS` and `GOARCH` allow you to cross-compile, and so on.

### Using a driver fork

`usqlgen` can build `usql` with a `replace` directive so that you can use a
SQL driver fork while keeping the `usql` configuration for the target database.
Information commands, schema exploration, and autocomplete will continue to work
if the fork remains compatible enough with the original.

For example, [github.com/dlapko/go-mssqldb](https://github.com/dlapko/go-mssqldb)
is a fork of [github.com/microsoft/go-mssqldb](https://github.com/microsoft/go-mssqldb)
with several fixes at the time of writing.

To build `usql` with the fork, run:

```shell
usqlgen build --replace "github.com/microsoft/go-mssqldb=github.com/dlapko/go-mssqldb@main"
```

Note that this works only with forks that keep the original module name - 
in this case `github.com/microsoft/go-mssqldb` - in their 
[go.mod](https://github.com/dlapko/go-mssqldb/blob/main/go.mod).
Such forks can only be used as replacements and can't be imported directly. 
For example, this command doesn't work:

```shell
usqlgen build --import "github.com/dlapko/go-mssqldb"
# the error output includes:
module declares its path as: github.com/microsoft/go-mssqldb
        but was required as: github.com/dlapko/go-mssqldb      
```

Forks that changed the module name to match their repository location can be imported with `--import`,
e.g. [github.com/yugabyte/pgx/stdlib](https://github.com/yugabyte/pgx).

### Using a specific version of a driver

If you are not happy with some driver or library version bundled with `usql`, you can change it in two ways.

The preferred approach is adding `--get` parameter to execute `go get` while building.
`go get` [may adjust](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-get) other dependencies to ensure compatibility with the updated version. 

```shell
usqlgen build --get "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql@v1.7.1"
```

If the adjustments made by `go get` are not wanted, you may add a `replace` directive instead:

```shell
usqlgen build --replace "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql=github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql@v1.7.1"
```

### "Off-label" usage

`usqlgen` may be useful even without changing drivers. For example, `usqlgen` provides the easiest way to
get a `usql` binary without installing it with a package manager or cloning its Git repository:

```shell
go run github.com/sclgo/usqlgen@latest build 
```

`usqlgen` can also be used to add to `usql` packages that don't register drivers but provide some other
useful import side effects. For example, on Linux and MacOS, [github.com/tam7t/sigprof](https://github.com/tam7t/sigprof) adds
helpful signal handlers for troubleshooting - `usqlgen` itself is using it. Example command:

Note that if none of the packages that you imported registered any drivers, you will see a warning
every time you start `usql`.

```shell
$ usqlgen build -i github.com/tam7t/sigprof
$ ./usql
Did not find new drivers in packages [github.com/tam7t/sigprof]. Either the packages ...
...
```

## Troubleshooting

`usqlgen` generates and compiles a binary which can become pretty big so execution may take a bit of time.
If `usqlgen` appears stuck, you can send the `USR1` signal to dump a file in your temp directory
with the current stacktrace of all goroutines (Go lightweight threads). On Linux, an easy way to send
the `USR1` signal is:

```shell
pkill -USR1 usqlgen
```

The program *won't* exit!

On Linux and MacOS, `usqlgen` uses the `sigprof` library to implement this feature. Review 
[its documentation](https://github.com/tam7t/sigprof) for other troubleshooting options it provides in `usqlgen`.

Besides that, `usqlgen` supports standard options for troubleshooting Golang applications e.g.
sending the `QUIT` signal or typing `Ctrl-\` on the console will print all stacktraces, then
stop the program.
